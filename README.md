- [x] Implemented classification of mushrooms as poisoned or non-poisonous using the Mushroom Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- [x] Used logistic regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest Techniques to achieve the same.
- [x] Compared the relative performance of the different algorithms on the basis of their ROC curve, precision-recall curve and confusion matrix.
- [x] Presented the results using Streamlit and used scikit-learn library for the machine learning functionalities.
